## üìÑ Summary of Your Solution (under 150 words)

**LearnPath Navigator** is an AI-powered Moodle plugin that revolutionizes personalized learning through intelligent roadmap generation and study resource recommendations.

**Problem**: Traditional LMS platforms provide generic learning paths that don't adapt to individual student performance, leading to inefficient learning and poor outcomes.

**Solution**: Our plugin analyzes student performance data and uses Snowflake's AI capabilities to generate personalized 3-step learning roadmaps with specific, actionable modules (e.g., "Complete 50 algebra problems") and curated study resources from platforms like Khan Academy, Desmos, and PhET. The system dynamically adapts to student weaknesses and provides targeted recommendations.

**Technologies**: Moodle Plugin Architecture, Snowflake Cortex AI, PHP, JavaScript, HTML5/CSS3, REST APIs, Khan Academy-inspired UI design.
