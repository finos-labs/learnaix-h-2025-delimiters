## Overview

LearnPath Navigator is a Moodle plugin that leverages Snowflake Cortex AI to provide personalized learning analytics and adaptive roadmap generation for students. The plugin analyzes student performance data and generates customized study plans using real AI models.

## Features

- ü§ñ **Real AI Analysis**: Powered by Snowflake Cortex AI (mistral-7b, llama3.1, etc.)
- üìä **Performance Analytics**: Detailed analysis of student strengths and weaknesses
- üßÆ **Gradebook Integration**: Pulls live grades and activity completion data directly from Moodle course gradebooks to drive AI insights
- üó∫Ô∏è **Personalized Roadmaps**: Custom learning paths based on individual performance
- üéØ **Multi-Profile Support**: Handles struggling, average, and advanced students
- ‚ö° **Real-time Processing**: Live AI responses with intelligent fallbacks
- üîß **Configurable**: Admin settings for Snowflake connection and AI models

## Requirements

- Moodle 4.0+ (tested on 4.1+)
- PHP 7.4+
- Snowflake CLI installed and configured
- Snowflake account with Cortex AI access
- Cross-region Cortex AI enabled (if needed)

## Installation

### 1. Install the Plugin

Copy the plugin to your Moodle installation:

```bash
# For Windows (XAMPP)
cp -r learnpath/ C:\xampp\htdocs\moodle\local\

# For Linux

## Technical Architecture

```
Moodle Plugin ‚Üí Snowflake CLI ‚Üí Snowflake Cortex AI ‚Üí AI Response
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                    ‚Üì              ‚Üì
  PHP/AJAX    ‚Üí  PowerShell     ‚Üí    mistral-7b    ‚Üí   JSON
```

### Key Components

- **`index.php`**: Main interface with student selection and AI controls
- **`ajax.php`**: AJAX handler for real-time AI requests
- **`classes/snowflake_connector.php`**: Snowflake CLI integration
- **`classes/student_data.php`**: Student data management and AI prompts
- **`settings.php`**: Admin configuration panel
- **`version.php`**: Plugin metadata and version info

### Moodle Gradebook Integration

- **Live Grade Sync**: `classes/student_data.php` calls Moodle's gradebook APIs to pull the latest course grades, quiz attempts, and activity completions for the selected learner.
- **Performance Hashing**: Roadmap persistence leverages a score hash to detect grade changes, automatically triggering roadmap regeneration when fresh gradebook data arrives.
- **Dashboards & AI Context**: The analytics dashboard and Snowflake prompts include grade averages, weak-topic detection, and completion gaps sourced directly from Moodle grade tables.
- **Role-Aware Access**: Capability checks in `index.php` ensure only permitted teachers or admins can view aggregated grade analytics, while students see only their own performance footprints.

## Configuration Files

### Snowflake CLI Setup
Ensure your Snowflake CLI is configured with:
```toml
[connections.your_connection_name]
account = "your_account_id"
user = "your_username"
password = "your_password"
role = "your_role"
database = "your_database"
schema = "PUBLIC"
warehouse = "your_warehouse"
```

### Required Snowflake Permissions
```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
ALTER ACCOUNT SET ENABLE_CROSS_REGION_CORTEX_CALLS = TRUE;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER TO ROLE your_role;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Connection not configured" error**
   - Check Snowflake CLI installation
   - Verify connection name in settings
   - Ensure config path is correct

2. **"AI model unavailable" error**
   - Enable cross-region Cortex calls
   - Try different AI model in settings
   - Check Snowflake account permissions

3. **Plugin not appearing**
   - Clear Moodle cache
   - Check file permissions
   - Verify plugin is in correct directory

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode in settings to see detailed error messages and AI response parsing.
